# Neurospora crassa classic mutant analyses
Analysis of 500+ Classic Mutants

This is a repository to support data analysis for the 500+ morphlogical mutant strain collection for Neurospora crassa housed in at the FGSC. These data were sequenced by JGI through a CSP project to Scott Baker and Kevin McCluskey.

The files support data downloads and construction of metadata tables from the public NCBI SRA and BioProject records. 
The work here can support data interrogation and loading of these genomes into http://fungidb.org or other resources.
